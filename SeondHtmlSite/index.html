            </h2>
            <p> 
                The article HTML element represents a self-contained 
                    composition in a document, page, application, or site, 
                    which is intended to be independently distributable or 
                    reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, 
                    a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card,
                    a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget,
                    or any other independent item of content.

                <h4>Global attributes</h4>
                <p> Global attributes are attributes common to 
                    all HTML elements; they can be used on all
                     elements, though they
                     may have no effect on some
                      elements.
